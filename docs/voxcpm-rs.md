# voxcpm-rs

Pure-Rust inference for [**VoxCPM2**](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/VoxCPM2) — a zero-shot
text-to-speech model with voice cloning — built on top of the
[Burn](https://burn.dev) ML framework.

Runs locally on your machine via **Vulkan** (AMD, NVIDIA, Intel) or a **pure-CPU**
fallback. No Python, no CUDA, no ONNX runtime — just a cargo dependency.

```rust
let model: VoxCPM<B> = VoxCPM::from_local("./VoxCPM2", &device)?;
let wav = model.generate("Hello, world!", GenerateOptions::default())?;
voxcpm_rs::audio::write_wav("out.wav", &wav, model.sample_rate())?;
```

## Why

The upstream VoxCPM2 reference is Python + PyTorch + CUDA. That is a heavy
dependency tree to ship inside a desktop app, a game, a CLI tool, or any other
Rust project where you want offline, on-device TTS.

`voxcpm-rs` is a single `cargo add` away and runs on:

- Any **Vulkan**-capable GPU (AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, Apple via MoltenVK).
- **Pure CPU** with SIMD elementwise ops, optionally with vendored OpenBLAS for
  multi-core matmul — no system libraries required.

It aims to stay faithful to the official implementation (see `vendor/VoxCPM`) while
exposing a small, idiomatic Rust API.

## Quick start

1. **Grab a checkpoint.** Download the VoxCPM2 weights from Hugging Face:

   ```bash
   huggingface-cli download openbmb/VoxCPM2 --local-dir ./VoxCPM2
   ```

   You should end up with a directory containing `config.json`, `tokenizer.json`,
   `model.safetensors`, and `audiovae.pth`. The crate consumes this layout
   **as-shipped** — no manual weight conversion step is required. See
   [Model files](#model-files) below for the full accepted layout.

2. **Add the crate:**

   ```toml
   # Cargo.toml
   [dependencies]
   voxcpm-rs = { version = "0.1", default-features = false, features = ["wgpu"] }
   ```

3. **Synthesize something:**

   ```rust
   use voxcpm_rs::{audio, GenerateOptions, VoxCPM};

   type B = burn::backend::Wgpu<f32, i32>;

   fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
       let device = Default::default();
       // Load once — takes ~20–25 s for the full model on a modern GPU.
       // Subsequent `generate()` calls reuse the same loaded model.
       let model: VoxCPM<B> = VoxCPM::from_local("./VoxCPM2", &device)?;

       let wav_1 = model.generate("First sentence.",  GenerateOptions::default())?;
       let wav_2 = model.generate("Second sentence.", GenerateOptions::default())?;

       audio::write_wav("out1.wav", &wav_1, model.sample_rate())?;
       audio::write_wav("out2.wav", &wav_2, model.sample_rate())?;
       Ok(())
   }
   ```

   `VoxCPM::generate` takes `&self`, so one loaded model can serve any number
   of **sequential** synthesis calls without reloading. Note however that
   `VoxCPM<B>` is **not `Sync`** — burn's `Param<Tensor<...>>` wraps a
   `std::cell::OnceCell` for lazy device materialization, which transitively
   makes the whole model `!Sync`. To share a single loaded model across
   threads or async tasks, wrap it in `Arc<Mutex<VoxCPM<B>>>` (or
   `Arc<parking_lot::Mutex<...>>`) and serialize `generate` calls; for true
   parallel inference, load one `VoxCPM<B>` per worker.

4. **Or just run the bundled example:**

   ```bash
   cargo run --release --example tts --no-default-features --features wgpu -- \
       ./VoxCPM2 "Hello world from Rust." /tmp/out.wav
   ```

### Model files

`VoxCPM::from_local` expects a directory with:

| File                      | Purpose                               | Format accepted                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `config.json`             | Model architecture config             | JSON                                 |
| `tokenizer.json`          | HuggingFace tokenizer                 | JSON                                 |
| `model.safetensors`  / `model.pth`    | LM + DiT backbone weights | SafeTensors preferred, `.pth`/`.pt` fallback |
| `audiovae.safetensors` / `audiovae.pth` | AudioVAE decoder weights | SafeTensors preferred, `.pth` fallback   |

The upstream HF repo currently ships `model.safetensors` + `audiovae.pth`; both
work directly with no conversion. PyTorch `state_dict.`/`model.`/`module.`
top-level container prefixes are stripped automatically.

Weight loading takes ~20–25 s on first call (a 4.3 GB BF16 backbone is upcast
to F32 for the `wgpu` backend — WGSL has no BF16 type). The cost is paid
**once** per `from_local`; subsequent `generate()` calls are free of any I/O.
Load-phase progress is reported via the [`log`](https://crates.io/crates/log)
crate, so wiring up `env_logger` / `tracing-log` surfaces it.


## Backends & features

Pick exactly one backend:

| Feature        | Backend             | Notes                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cpu` *(default)* | `burn-ndarray` + SIMD | Works everywhere. Matmul is single-threaded.                          |
| `cpu-blas`     | `cpu` + vendored OpenBLAS | Multi-core matmul. Builds OpenBLAS from source (no system deps).    |
| `wgpu`         | Vulkan / Metal / DX12 | Recommended for GPUs. Fast cold start.                              |
| `wgpu-fast`    | `wgpu` + fusion + autotune | ~5–7% faster steady-state; pays a one-time autotune cost (cached). |
| `vulkan`       | Native Vulkan + **bf16** weights | ~2.6× faster than `wgpu` on AMD RDNA4. **Requires a patch** — see below. |
| `webgpu`       | **Browser**, `wasm32-unknown-unknown` | WGSL via WebGPU. F32 weights. See [Browser](#browser-wasm--webgpu). |
| `webgpu-f16`   | `webgpu` + F16 weights | Halves VRAM to 4.4 GB. Needs adapter `shader-f16`. |

```bash
# CPU + BLAS
cargo run --release --example tts --no-default-features --features cpu-blas -- ...

# Vulkan, tuned
cargo run --release --example tts --no-default-features --features wgpu-fast -- ...
```

> **Tip:** with `wgpu-fast`, set `CUBECL_AUTOTUNE_LEVEL=minimal` to shrink the
> first-run autotune cost. Results are cached in `target/autotune/`.

### Bf16 Vulkan backend (opt-in, fastest path)

The `vulkan` feature uses Burn's native Vulkan backend and runs the model in
**bf16** end-to-end (the upstream weight dtype — no f32 upcast, half the VRAM,
substantially faster on bf16-capable hardware). Verified ~2.6× speedup over
`wgpu` on an AMD RX 9070 XT (RDNA4).

It needs two small patches that aren't in the released `burn-cubecl` /
`cubecl-spirv` crates yet — one fixes a conv accumulator dtype, the other
promotes a handful of bf16 SPIR-V ops that mesa's NIR translator doesn't lower
correctly. Add this to **your project's** `Cargo.toml` (alongside
`voxcpm-rs = { …, features = ["vulkan"] }`):

```toml
[patch.crates-io]
burn-cubecl  = { git = "https://github.com/mii-nipah/voxcpm-rs", branch = "main" }
cubecl-spirv = { git = "https://github.com/mii-nipah/voxcpm-rs", branch = "main" }
```

That's it — `cargo` clones the repo, finds the patched crates by name, and
rebuilds. No mesa rebuild, no environment variables, no extra steps. Pin to a
specific `rev = "…"` instead of `branch = "main"` for reproducible builds.

> **Why a patch and not a published crate?** Cargo's `[patch.crates-io]` only
> takes effect at the workspace root, so a library can't transparently pull in
> a patched dependency on its consumers' behalf — the patch block must live in
> the consumer's manifest either way. A `git = "…"` reference is the lowest-
> friction form that doesn't require maintaining renamed forks on crates.io.
> See [`patches/README.md`](../patches/README.md) for the patch contents and
> rationale.

## Browser: WASM + WebGPU

VoxCPM2 runs entirely in a browser tab — WASM for the model code, WebGPU
for every kernel. No inference server, no WebSocket backend, no CPU
fallback. A local HTTP server only serves static files and the checkpoint.

```
text ──► WASM (voxcpm-rs) ──► WebGPU compute ──► Vec<f32> PCM
                                                      │
                                      Float32Array ───┴──► AudioBuffer ──► speakers
```

### Build and run

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version "$(awk '/^name = "wasm-bindgen"$/{f=1;next} f&&/^version/{gsub(/[":]/,"");print $3;exit}' Cargo.lock)"

# one-time: upstream ships the AudioVAE only as a PyTorch pickle, which the
# browser build cannot read (it would need `zip` -> `zstd-sys`, i.e. C).
cargo run --release --example convert_audiovae \
    --no-default-features --features cpu -- /path/to/VoxCPM2

scripts/build-web.sh                 # F32 weights  (needs >=12 GB VRAM)
scripts/build-web.sh --f16           # F16 weights  (needs >=8 GB VRAM)

python3 scripts/serve.py --model /path/to/VoxCPM2
# open http://localhost:8080
```

Then: **Self-test WebGPU** → **Load model** → **Generate**.

### Opening it from another machine (tailnet / LAN)

**WebGPU requires a secure context.** `http://localhost` counts as one by
special case; `http://100.x.y.z:8080` from another machine does not, so
`navigator.gpu` is simply `undefined` there. Binding the server to
`0.0.0.0` gets you a page that loads and then reports no WebGPU — no
server setting can change that. It has to be HTTPS.

On a tailnet that is one flag:

```bash
python3 scripts/serve.py --model /path/to/VoxCPM2 --tailscale
#   open this on any tailnet machine:  https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8080/
```

That asks `tailscale cert` for a real Let's Encrypt certificate for this
node's MagicDNS name, serves HTTPS with it, and binds **only** this
node's Tailscale v4 and v6 addresses — so the 4.4 GB checkpoint is not
also exposed on your LAN or any public interface. No sudo, no browser
flags, no certificate warnings. It needs HTTPS enabled for the tailnet
([docs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https)); you already have
it if `tailscale status --json` lists `CertDomains`.

Verified from a non-localhost origin: `isSecureContext = true`,
`navigator.gpu` available, `crossOriginIsolated = true`, self-test passes.
Serving the same page over plain HTTP to the same client instead gives
`isSecureContext = false` and `navigator.gpu = MISSING`, and the page now
says exactly that and how to fix it rather than blaming your GPU.

To drop the `:8080` from the URL, `tailscale serve --bg 8080` will front
it on 443. The script does not do that for you because it changes
persistent `tailscaled` state; it only reads a certificate.

Other options:

| situation | what to do |
| --- | --- |
| Not on a tailnet | `--tls-cert` / `--tls-key` with any cert the client trusts (e.g. `mkcert`) |
| Just want it local | default — `http://localhost:8080` is already a secure context |
| Can't do HTTPS at all | on the *client*, launch Chrome with `--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://HOST:8080` |

The server is not the bottleneck for the 4.4 GB load: a 256 MB range came
back at ~1.5 GB/s through Python's TLS locally, so real load time is
whatever your link does. The checkpoint is served `immutable` with a
long max-age, so the browser HTTP cache absorbs reloads.

### The server must support HTTP Range

`model.safetensors` is 4.37 GB and `wasm32` has a 4 GB address space, so
the checkpoint is never materialized. Only its header is parsed up front;
tensors are then fetched, converted and uploaded to the GPU a module at a
time (`src/stream.rs`), keeping peak WASM heap near 1.3 GB at F32.
`scripts/serve.py` answers `Range` requests; `python3 -m http.server`
does **not**, and the loader will say so rather than trying to allocate
4.4 GB.

### Memory

| | GPU (weights) | peak WASM heap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F32 (`webgpu`) | 8.74 GB | ~2.0 GB |
| F16 (`webgpu-f16`) | 4.37 GB | ~1.1 GB |

Full breakdown, measurements and the quantization plan:
[`docs/webgpu-memory.md`](webgpu-memory.md).

### It will not silently run on the CPU

Chrome hands out a SwiftShader (software) adapter when it cannot reach
the GPU. For a 2.3 B-parameter model that means hours per utterance, so
the demo refuses it by default and tells you what to fix — on Linux,
usually that your user is not in the `render`/`video` groups. Tick
*Allow a software WebGPU adapter* to override, for correctness testing
only.

### Testing the browser path without a browser

`src/stream.rs` is platform-independent and sits behind a `ByteSource`
trait, so the same loader runs over a local file:

```bash
# streams the checkpoint, then generates through `generate_async` —
# the exact code path the browser uses
cargo run --release --example stream_load \
    --no-default-features --features wgpu -- \
    /path/to/VoxCPM2 "こんにちは。" /tmp/out.wav --async
```

It reports true peak heap (via a tracking allocator, not RSS) and is a
good deal easier to debug than a tab.

### Status

Verified in headless Chrome 154: self-test, model load
(`applied=632, missing=0, errors=0`, 35.7 s) and generation all pass.
With the sampler made deterministic on both sides, browser output matches
a native RTX 4090 run at **correlation 1.000000**, max difference 0.04 %
of peak — i.e. identical to f32 rounding.

Those browser runs used Chrome's SwiftShader (CPU) adapter, because the
test machine's browser could not reach its GPU. That validates
correctness completely and says nothing about speed; the RTF figures
quoted here are all from native runs on the same code paths. See
`docs/browser-port-analysis.md` §4c.

### Checking the browser against native

Browser and native output are not bit-identical — the flow-matching
sampler draws Gaussian noise, and WGSL reduction order differs between
implementations. To compare them properly, zero the noise on both sides:

```bash
# native reference
VOXCPM_Z_ZERO=1 VOXCPM_DUMP_F32=1 cargo run --release --example stream_load \
    --no-default-features --features wgpu -- \
    /path/to/VoxCPM2 "こんにちは。" /tmp/native.wav --async --max-len 3

# browser: tick "Deterministic", Generate, then grab window.__voxPcm
python3 scripts/compare_pcm.py /tmp/native.wav.f32 /tmp/browser.f32
```

`VOXCPM_Z_ZERO` degrades the audio (it removes part of the sampler), so
judge *agreement* with it on, and quality with it off.

### Porting notes

- [`docs/browser-port-analysis.md`](browser-port-analysis.md) — the
  architecture survey, every blocker found, and what was done about each.
- [`docs/webgpu-memory.md`](webgpu-memory.md) — measured memory and
  the F16 / INT8 / INT4 plan.
- [`patches/README.md`](../patches/README.md) — includes the
  `cubek-reduce` workgroup fix, without which the model cannot run on any
  WebGPU adapter at the spec-baseline limits.

### Streaming playback

Tick *Stream audio while generating* to play each chunk as it is
produced. This is real incremental decoding — the model runs
`chunk_patches` autoregressive steps, decodes, and emits — not a finished
waveform cut into pieces. Chunk boundaries are seamless because the
AudioVAE decoder is causal.

Measured natively on an RTX 4090 (F32, `--stream`, 7.5 s utterance):
first audio at **14.5 s**, then a chunk every 10–18 s. The per-chunk time
grows because each chunk re-decodes the whole accumulated latent —
`O(N^2)` across an utterance. That is the simple, correct version;
porting Python's stateful `StreamingVAEDecoder` would make it linear.

The UI reports time-to-first-audio and counts buffer underruns (chunks
that arrived after their playback slot), which is the honest measure of
whether a given machine is keeping up.

### Not yet done

- **Local checkpoint caching.** A page reload re-downloads the model,
  modulo the HTTP cache. Cache Storage or OPFS keyed on a manifest hash
  would fix it; the loader already goes through `ByteSource`, so a
  cache-backed source drops in beside `HttpRangeSource`.
- **Quantization.** F16 is wired as a build flag; INT8 / INT4 are
  designed but not implemented. See `docs/webgpu-memory.md` §5.
- **Linear-time streaming decode** (see above).

## API tour

### Zero-shot synthesis

```rust
let wav = model.generate("Good morning.", GenerateOptions::default())?;
```

### Voice cloning

Provide a short reference clip (ideally a few seconds of clean speech):

```rust
use voxcpm_rs::Prompt;

let opts = GenerateOptions::builder()
    .prompt(Prompt::Reference { audio: "speaker.wav".into() })
    .build();

let wav = model.generate("Now I sound like them.", opts)?;
```

Or continue from an existing utterance (the model picks up after `audio`):

```rust
let opts = GenerateOptions::builder()
    .prompt(Prompt::Continuation {
        audio: "intro.wav".into(),
        text:  "Once upon a time,".into(),
    })
    .build();
```

#### Audio from memory

Prompt audio doesn't have to live on disk. [`PromptAudio`](../src/voxcpm2/wrapper.rs)
accepts three sources — a path, already-encoded bytes, or raw PCM samples — so
you can plug the model into an in-memory pipeline (microphone capture, HTTP
upload, another TTS stage, …):

```rust
use voxcpm_rs::{Prompt, PromptAudio};

// 1. From a file path (the default — `Into<PromptAudio>` is implemented for
//    `&str`, `&Path` and `PathBuf`):
let a = Prompt::Reference { audio: "speaker.wav".into() };

// 2. From encoded bytes in memory (any format Symphonia supports):
let bytes: Vec<u8> = std::fs::read("speaker.flac")?;
let b = Prompt::Reference { audio: PromptAudio::Encoded(bytes) };

// 3. From raw mono f32 PCM you already have:
let c = Prompt::Reference {
    audio: PromptAudio::Pcm { samples, sample_rate: 24_000 },
};
```

Symmetrically, [`audio::load_audio_bytes`](../src/audio.rs) /
[`audio::load_audio_bytes_as`](../src/audio.rs) let you decode encoded audio
buffers without touching the filesystem.

### Streaming

For real-time playback, network streaming, or just to start hearing audio
before the whole utterance is ready, use
[`VoxCPM::generate_stream`](../src/voxcpm2/wrapper.rs). It returns an iterator
of `Result<Vec<f32>>` chunks at `model.sample_rate()`:

```rust
let opts = GenerateOptions::builder()
    .chunk_patches(5)   // ~400 ms / chunk at the default model config
    .build();

for chunk in model.generate_stream("Streaming hello!", opts)? {
    let chunk = chunk?;
    audio_sink.write(&chunk); // play / send / encode immediately
}
```

Concatenating every chunk yields exactly the same waveform `generate()`
would have returned — chunk boundaries are seamless because the AudioVAE
decoder is causal. `chunk_patches` trades latency for throughput: smaller
→ lower per-chunk latency, larger → fewer chunks. The default `5` is a
sensible balance for live playback.

See [`examples/tts_stream.rs`](../examples/tts_stream.rs) for an end-to-end
run with per-chunk timing.

> **Implementation note.** The autoregressive loop (LM + DiT) runs
> incrementally with KV-cache, so streaming adds **no** AR overhead
> compared to `generate()`. The AudioVAE decoder, however, is currently
> stateless across chunks — each chunk re-decodes the cumulative latent
> and emits only the new tail samples, making total VAE work
> `O(N²/chunk_patches)` over an utterance instead of `O(N)`. AR cost
> dominates in practice, so the difference is rarely visible.

### Throughput: batched & parallel-segment generation

Single-utterance inference at batch size 1 is launch-bound on most modern
GPUs — the kernels are fast, but each one carries fixed dispatch overhead
and each weight matrix is re-read from VRAM per call. Both costs amortize
beautifully across a larger batch, so running multiple sequences through
one forward pass gives close-to-linear speedup until you hit the actual
compute or memory ceiling. **This benefits every backend** (Vulkan / wgpu
/ CPU, fp32 or bf16) — it is a property of the dispatch model, not of the
numeric format.

`voxcpm-rs` exposes two complementary APIs that share the same right-pad
batched-prefill + per-element stop machinery underneath.

#### `VoxCPM::batch()` — independent utterances at once

When you have several unrelated requests (a server handling N clients, a
batch job rendering many lines), put them into one batch and get one PCM
buffer per item back, in order. Each item carries its own [`Prompt`], so
different items can use different reference voices in the same batch.

```rust
use voxcpm_rs::{GenerateOptions, Prompt, VoxCPM};

let outs: Vec<Vec<f32>> = model
    .batch()
    .add("Hello, world!",          Prompt::None)
    .add("Goodbye, world!",        Prompt::None)
    .add("And one with a voice.",  Prompt::Reference { audio: ref_audio })
    .run(GenerateOptions::default())?;

for (i, pcm) in outs.iter().enumerate() {
    voxcpm_rs::audio::write_wav(format!("out_{i}.wav"), pcm, model.sample_rate())?;
}
```

Measured on an AMD RX 9070 XT (Vulkan + bf16, 8 short utterances):

| Mode             | Wall time | Audio | RTF       | Speedup |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----- | --------- | ------- |
| serial (b=1)     | 19.9 s    | 30.1s | 0.66      | 1.00×   |
| `batch` b=2      | 13.1 s    | 29.9s | 0.44      | 1.52×   |
| `batch` b=4      |  9.9 s    | 29.8s | 0.33      | 2.00×   |
| **`batch` b=8**  |  **8.6 s**| 29.0s | **0.30**  | **2.31×** |

RTF below 1.0 means faster than realtime — at b=8 the GPU produces audio
~3.4× faster than playback speed.

#### `parallel_segments` — split one paragraph, share one voice

For a single long text (a book chapter, a long reply), set
[`GenerateOptions::parallel_segments(n)`]: `voxcpm-rs` splits the text on
sentence boundaries and feeds groups of `n` segments through the same
batched path. To keep the voice consistent across sentences when no
reference audio is supplied, the first segment is generated serially and
its audio is encoded as the reference for the rest ("self-seeding");
with [`Prompt::Reference`] the user-provided voice is used directly and
everything runs batched.

```rust
let opts = GenerateOptions::builder()
    .parallel_segments(8)   // batch size for the segment groups
    .build();
let wav = model.generate("… long paragraph with many sentences …", opts)?;
```

Same hardware, 10-sentence paragraph:

| Mode                       | Wall time | Audio | RTF       | Speedup vs per-sentence serial |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ----- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| per-sentence serial        | 22.0 s    | 34.1s | 0.65      | 1.00×                           |
| `parallel_segments(2)`     | 24.8 s    | 49.9s | 0.50      | 0.89×                           |
| `parallel_segments(4)`     | 18.6 s    | 43.2s | 0.43      | 1.18×                           |
| **`parallel_segments(8)`** | **12.8 s**| 34.1s | **0.38**  | **1.72×**                       |

(The audio-length differences come from the per-sentence stop head
firing at slightly different points; RTF is the apples-to-apples number.)

**Which one to use?** If you have multiple independent inputs, prefer
`batch()` — there is no first-segment serial step, so the speedup is
purely batched. If you have *one* long text and want the whole thing
ready faster, use `parallel_segments`.

**Warning**

Parallel segments may degrade voice consistency and quality, use with caution.

#### How far does batching scale?

Batching helps as long as the GPU is launch-bound; once each step
saturates compute or memory, adding more elements just adds proportional
work. To find the sweet spot we generated the same medium sentence N
times in one batch (so no element dominates) and swept N. RX 9070 XT,
Vulkan + bf16:

Takeaways:

- **b=1 → b=2 is literally free** — at b=1 the GPU is 100 % launch-bound,
  so the second sequence rides along at zero extra cost.
- **b=8 is the sweet spot on this card** — peak throughput 3.75× realtime.
- **b≥16 starts regressing.** Past saturation, more batch members do not
  hide step cost; they only add proportional work, and at b=64 something
  (likely allocator pressure or an autotune miss for the rare giant
  shape) makes things noticeably worse.
- These numbers are hardware-specific. The shape of the curve
  (free-doubling at small B, peak somewhere around 4–8, regression past
  the GPU's saturation point) is universal — re-run
  [`examples/batch_scale_sweep.rs`](../examples/batch_scale_sweep.rs) on
  your own hardware to find your own sweet spot.

For a server batching independent requests, target b=4–8 and queue
beyond that; for latency-sensitive interactive use, treat b=8 as the
upper bound.

### Tuning knobs

All options flow through the fluent builder:

```rust
let opts = GenerateOptions::builder()
    .cfg(2.0)          // classifier-free guidance; 1.5–3.0 is typical
    .timesteps(10)     // diffusion Euler steps; fewer = faster, <6 degrades
    .min_len(2)
    .max_len(500)      // hard cap on generated latent patches (~80 ms each)
    .chunk_patches(5)  // patches per chunk in `generate_stream`
    .build();
```

### Cancellation

Long generations can be cancelled cooperatively from another thread via
`CancelToken`. The autoregressive loop polls the token between every
diffusion step, so cancel latency is bounded by one step
(~200 ms on `wgpu` at default `timesteps=10`).

```rust
use std::{thread, time::Duration};
use voxcpm_rs::{CancelToken, Error, GenerateOptions};

let cancel = CancelToken::new();
{
    let cancel = cancel.clone();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5));
        cancel.cancel(); // safe to call from any thread, idempotent
    });
}

let opts = GenerateOptions::builder().cancel(cancel).build();
match model.generate("a very long passage…", opts) {
    Ok(wav) => { /* finished in time */ }
    Err(Error::Cancelled) => { /* user / watchdog bailed */ }
    Err(e) => return Err(e.into()),
}
```

`CancelToken` is `Clone + Send + Sync` (an `Arc<AtomicBool>` underneath),
so you can hand copies to as many watchers as you like.

## Architecture

VoxCPM2 is a cascade of four components — each lives in its own module:

```
text ──► tokenizer ──► minicpm4 (LM backbone) ──► locenc ──► locdit (diffusion) ──► audiovae ──► wav
```

| Module                                | Role                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`tokenizer`](../src/tokenizer.rs)       | HF `tokenizers` wrapper for the LlamaTokenizerFast vocab. |
| [`minicpm4`](../src/minicpm4/)           | Decoder-only LM backbone (rotary attention + KV cache).   |
| [`locenc`](../src/locenc.rs)             | Local encoder — conditions the diffusion head on LM hidden states. |
| [`locdit`](../src/locdit/)               | Local DiT + conditional flow-matching sampler.         |
| [`audiovae`](../src/audiovae/)           | VAE decoder that turns FSQ patches into 16 kHz audio.  |
| [`voxcpm2`](../src/voxcpm2/)             | Glue + convenient [`VoxCPM`](../src/voxcpm2/wrapper.rs) façade. |

Weights are loaded directly from `.safetensors` or `.pth` via
[`burn-store`](https://crates.io/crates/burn-store) with the `PyTorchToBurnAdapter`,
so HuggingFace checkpoints drop in with no manual conversion step.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome — especially:

- Bug reports with a minimal repro and the backend/feature flags you used.
- Performance PRs (kernels, memory layout, KV cache, sampler).
- New backends supported by Burn (CUDA, Metal direct, etc.).

Before opening a PR:

1. `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --all-targets`.
2. `cargo test --no-default-features --features cpu`.
3. If you touched a numeric path, run the matching `*_check` example against a
   real checkpoint and include the RTF / parity numbers in the PR description.

Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR makes review much easier.
